I am a graduate student in the [Department of Statistics](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/) at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/). 

I am supervised by [Benjamin Bloem-Reddy](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/~benbr/) and [Alexandre Bouchard-C&ocirc;t&eacute;](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/~bouchard/index.html).

I received a B.Sc. in Mathematics from [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/), where I did research in computational biology under the guidance of [Cedric Chauve](https://cchauve.github.io/) and [Leonid Chindelevitch](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/l.chindelevitch).
